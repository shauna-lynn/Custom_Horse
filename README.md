# Smokey Black Black Star Friesian Horse for RedM

** NOTE 10/25/2024 - It has been brought to my attention that the reason the spaghetti legs are gone is because I used CodeX to save the file as a binary - not because of the name in the file. I did not realise at the time that I was doing a step that wasn't initially explained! I am unsure if adding the name to the file itself has any sort of benefit or if it's just something silly that doesn't need to be there. **

If you were watching my stream â€“ I swear it worked! I must have gotten lucky the first time I played with it. This is the RedM ported version of the [Smokey Black Black Star Friesian horse](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/2352) from Nexus Mods. Looking back on the VOD, the first attempt did not work as in the `fxmanifest.lua` we had written `files 'metapeds.ymt'` which is incorrect - it should have been `file 'metapeds.ymt'` or ```files { 'metapeds.ymt' }``` but for a VERY ROUGH video tutorial on the process you can view my [VOD on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2284448223) - just keep in mind it didn't work because of the fxmanifest. The process remains the same. I am positive the native skins did not work because of the naming conventions of the textures.

## Overview

When streaming an edited `.ymt` file based on the information provided in [How to Add a New Custom Horse](https://forum.cfx.re/t/how-to-add-a-new-custom-horse), the horse model works to an extent, but there are issues:

- **Missing Reins**: The horse spawns without reins.
- **Deformed Legs**: Coining the nickname "spaghetti legs."

Interestingly, I found that adding the model name into the `.ymt` file allows us to name the model whatever we want *and* it resolves the model deformations. However, fixing the reins seems to require adding the model to `reinsdefinition.ymt`, which I suspect uses the `REINS_DEFINITIONS_FILE` data loader in `fxmanifest`. Unfortunately, this feature is not supported by CFX at this time.
